# Cat and Dog Image Classification

# Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images of cats and dogs. The project leverages deep learning techniques for image classification and provides both training and testing functionalities using Jupyter notebooks.

# Files 
- **cat-dog-prediction.ipynb**: This notebook contains the steps for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model for classifying cat and dog images.
- **cat_dog_saved_model.ipynb**: This notebook is used to load and test the saved model (cat_dog_prediction.h5) on new images of cats and dogs.
- **cat_dog_prediction.h5**: The pre-trained model file that can be loaded to classify new images without the need to retrain the model.
- **README.md**: This file provides documentation and instructions for using the project.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to classify images of cats and dogs using deep learning. The model is trained to accurately distinguish between images of the two animals. This classification system can be expanded for use in a variety of computer vision tasks.

# Instructions
**Dataset:**
Use a labeled dataset containing images of cats and dogs. The dataset should be split into training and testing sets.

**Model Training (cat-dog-prediction.ipynb):**
- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook loads and augments the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying transformations for better generalization.
- **Model Building**: A CNN architecture is created to learn features from the images.
- **Training**: The model is trained on the dataset, and metrics like accuracy and loss are recorded.
- **Evaluation**: After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on the test set.

**Testing the Saved Model (cat_dog_saved_model.ipynb):**
- **Loading the Model**: Load the pre-trained model from the cat_dog_prediction.h5 file.
- **Image Classification**: Test new images from any directory and obtain predictions (cat or dog) for each image.
- **Output**: The model will output the predicted class (cat or dog) for the input image.

# Dependencies
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)

# Future Work
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with deeper or more advanced architectures to improve the model's accuracy.
- **Larger Dataset**: Training on a larger and more diverse dataset may help improve the generalization of the model.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a simple web interface to allow users to upload images and receive classification results.
